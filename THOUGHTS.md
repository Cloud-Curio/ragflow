# Development Process Thoughts

## 2025-07-05 23:57 UTC
- Initial exploration of repository. Confirmed existing React-based UI in `web/` which already uses TailwindCSS.
- Determined no AGENTS.md instructions exist, so following default workflow.
- Plan to add a new enterprise page that integrates a chat interface and document loader using existing components (`ChatContainer`, `FileUploader`).
- Will update routing and configuration to expose this page at `/enterprise`.
- Also will ensure OpenRouter models are included in `conf/llm_factories.json`.

- Created new `EnterprisePage` combining existing chat container and file uploader.
- Updated router to expose the new page.
- Added sample OpenRouter models in `conf/llm_factories.json` for agent configuration.
