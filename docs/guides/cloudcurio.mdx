# CloudCurio Deployment Overview

This guide outlines the high-level design for hosting the RAGFlow web interface on **cloudcurio.cc** and connecting it to a free-tier Oracle Cloud database using Terraform.

## Website Structure

The `web` directory contains a React frontend that can be built into a static bundle. Deploy the compiled assets to object storage (e.g., OCI Object Storage static site hosting) or any static hosting platform.

Recommended pages:

- **Home** – introduction and sign-in link
- **Dataset Explorer** – browse the `research` dataset
- **Agent Playground** – run sample agents from the `agent` folder
- **Docs** – link to these markdown guides

## Oracle Cloud Database

Use the Terraform configuration in `infrastructure/oci_free_tier` to provision an Autonomous Database. The output connection string can be saved as an environment variable for the backend API.

### Steps

1. Install Terraform and configure your OCI credentials.
2. Run `terraform init` then `terraform apply` in the `infrastructure/oci_free_tier` directory.
3. Update your backend configuration to point to the database connection string.

## Going Further

- Utilize the free tier to test RAG pipelines before scaling.
- Consider adding Terraform modules for compute instances or object storage if needed.
